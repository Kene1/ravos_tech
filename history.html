                    <p>RAVOS Technical College is a Trust located in Kanye, established in 1986
                         and registered with the Ministry of Education and Skills Development 
                         as a private vocational school in January 1990. The concerned parties to the establishment
                         of Ravos included Lutheran Churches, Minister of Education and Skills Development, 
                        Member of Parliament for Kanye, Kanye Local Authorities and Department of Secondary Education.
                        Ravos is currently registered and accredited by BQA to offer vocational training.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The College was established by deeds of Trust in 1994. Ramatea Vocational School, as the College has been known, was a partnership between the Lutheran Development Association and the Ministry of Education.  In 2013 the Ministry pulled out of this agreement for the simple reason that the Government wanted total ownership of the institution they have been invited to join. The Lutherans did not accept the proposal, hence the Ministry of Education pulled out.<br>

                    As the Government pulled out and the Germans who were running both RAVOS and LUDABO retired- this had a negative impact on both institutions.  It was easy for the expatriates (Germans) to source funds from partners in Europe and America. This was a double blow for the College financially.  
                        </p><br>
                    <p>RAVOS Quality Management Policy exists to see to it that RAVOS adhere to international/academic standards so that it produces value based graduates who will be equipped with industry â€“ relevant academic and professional qualifications to enable them to respond to the needs of the society and have solid values that foster a sense of community. Similarly, the Government established Botswana Qualification Authority (BQA), in order to make sure that all Education and Training providers (ETPs) in Botswana meet the international academic standard. To be registered and accredited with BQA required that institutions meet 18 criterions. 
                        <br><br>
                    Some of the requirements needed funding.  The College had to use all its resources in order to meet the requirements.  New equipment and landscaping was done for the College.  Extra meetings for executive were held, all these required money.  We are now pleased to report all these were not in vain, at the end RAVOS Technical College has been registered and accredited  by BQA.  Our registration number is 0043. However, this is not the end of the journey but the beginning of it.
